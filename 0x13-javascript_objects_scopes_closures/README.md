JavaScript Objects, Scopes, and Closures
This repository contains solutions for various tasks related to JavaScript objects, scopes, and closures.

Tasks:
Rectangle #0

Write an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle.
Must use the class notation.
Rectangle #1

Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle.
Constructor must take 2 arguments w and h.
Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w.
Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h.
Rectangle #2

Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle.
Constructor must take 2 arguments w and h.
Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w.
Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h.
If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object.
Rectangle #3

Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle.
Constructor must take 2 arguments: w and h.
Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w.
Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h.
If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object.
Create an instance method called print() that prints the rectangle using the character X.
Rectangle #4

Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle.
Constructor must take 2 arguments: w and h.
Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w.
Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h.
If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object.
Create an instance method called print() that prints the rectangle using the character X.
Create an instance method called rotate() that exchanges the width and the height of the rectangle.
Create an instance method called double() that multiples the width and the height of the rectangle by 2.
Square #0

Write a class Square that defines a square and inherits from Rectangle of 4-rectangle.js.
Constructor must take 1 argument: size.
The constructor of Rectangle must be called (by using super()).
Square #1

Write a class Square that defines a square and inherits from Square of 5-square.js.
Create an instance method called charPrint(c) that prints the rectangle using the character c.
If c is undefined, use the character X.
Occurrences

Write a function that returns the number of occurrences in a list.
Prototype: exports.nbOccurences = function (list, searchElement).
Esrever

Write a function that returns the reversed version of a list.
Prototype: exports.esrever = function (list).
Not allowed to use the built-in method reverse.
Log me

Write a function that prints the number of arguments already printed and the new argument value.
Prototype: exports.logMe = function (item).
Output format: <number arguments already printed>: <current argument value>.
Number conversion

Write a function that converts a number from base 10 to another base passed as argument.
Prototype: exports.converter = function (base).
Not allowed to import any file.
Not allowed to declare any new variable (var, let, etc.).
Factor index (Advanced)

Write a script that imports an array and computes a new array.
Must import list from the file 100-data.js.
Must use a map.
A new list must be created with each value equal to the value of the initial list, multipled by the index in the list.
Sorted occurrences (Advanced)

Write a script that imports a dictionary of occurrences by user id and computes a dictionary of user ids by occurrence.
Must import dict from the file 101-data.js.
In the new dictionary, a key is a number of occurrences and a value is the list of user ids.
Print the new dictionary at the end.
Concat files (Advanced)

Write a script that concats 2 files.
The first argument is the file path of the first source file.
The second argument is the file path of the second source file.
The third argument is the file path of the destination.
